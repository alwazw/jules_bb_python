# Phase 5: Customer Service Automation (Future Development)

This document outlines the plan for the Customer Service module, which will be developed in a future phase of the project. The goal of this module is to automate responses to common customer inquiries, manage returns, and flag conversations that require manual intervention.

## 1. Core Objectives

*   **Reduce Manual Workload:** Automate responses to frequently asked questions (FAQs) to free up customer service agents.
*   **Improve Response Time:** Provide instant answers to customers around the clock.
*   **Streamline Returns:** Automate the return merchandise authorization (RMA) process, including providing return shipping labels.
*   **Centralize Communication:** Aggregate customer messages from various channels into a single interface.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1. Message Aggregation

*   **Connect to Best Buy API:** The module will use the Best Buy API to pull in new customer messages.
*   **Real-time Notifications:** The system will check for new messages at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).
*   **Centralized Database:** All messages will be stored in a local database for history and analysis.

### 2.2. Automated Responses (The "Answer Bot")

*   **Intent Recognition:** The system will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the intent of a customer's message. Examples of intents include:
    *   `order_status_inquiry`
    *   `return_request`
    *   `product_question`
    *   `shipping_issue`
*   **Data-Driven Answers:** Based on the recognized intent, the bot will query internal data sources to provide an answer. For example:
    *   For an `order_status_inquiry`, it will look up the order in the `orders_shipped_and_validated.json` log and provide the latest tracking information.
    *   For a `return_request`, it will initiate the RMA process.
*   **Customizable Knowledge Base:** The bot will be configured with a knowledge base of custom instructions and answers for common questions (e.g., "How do I use this product?", "What is your return policy?").

### 2.3. Return Management Automation

*   **Automated RMA Creation:** When a `return_request` is detected, the system will automatically:
    1.  Verify that the order is within the return window.
    2.  Create a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number.
    3.  Generate a return shipping label using the Canada Post API.
    4.  Send the return instructions and the shipping label to the customer.
*   **Return Tracking:** The system will monitor the tracking number of the return shipment and update the status of the RMA accordingly.

### 2.4. Manual Intervention Workflow

*   **Flagging for Review:** If the bot cannot understand a message or if a customer's issue is too complex, the conversation will be flagged for manual review.
*   **Agent Interface:** A simple web-based interface will be developed for customer service agents to view and respond to flagged conversations.
*   **Escalation Paths:** The system will have defined escalation paths for different types of issues (e.g., complaints, technical problems).

## 3. Technical Implementation (High-Level)

*   **Python Backend:** The core logic will be built in Python.
*   **NLP Library:** A library such as `spaCy` or `NLTK` will be used for intent recognition.
*   **Database:** A lightweight database like `SQLite` will be used for storing messages and customer data.
*   **Web Framework:** A simple web framework like `Flask` or `FastAPI` will be used for the agent interface.
*   **API Integration:** The module will be tightly integrated with the Best Buy and Canada Post APIs.

This plan provides a high-level overview of the proposed Customer Service module. The features and implementation details will be further refined before development begins.
