# Phase 5: Customer Service

This document outlines the development plan for the Customer Service module.

## Phase 1: Message Aggregation

The first phase of the Customer Service module is to aggregate customer messages from the Best Buy API.

### Workflow

1.  **Connect to Best Buy API:** The system will connect to the Best Buy API to check for new customer messages.
2.  **Fetch Messages:** The system will retrieve any new messages that have not been processed.
3.  **Save Messages:** The fetched messages will be saved to a local data store for further processing.
4.  **Log Activity:** The system will log the number of messages retrieved and any errors that occurred during the process.

This phase will be integrated into the main scheduler to run at regular intervals.
