# V2 System Logic & Fulfillment Simulation

This document provides a conceptual simulation of the V2 architecture to validate its design and ensure it meets all requirements for robustness and error prevention.

---

### **Simulation Scenario**

*   **Example Order:** `ORDER-XYZ-123`
*   **Product:** A custom-built laptop based on a "Dell XPS 15" chassis.
*   **Bill of Materials (from our Database):**
    *   1x Dell XPS 15 (Base SKU)
    *   2x 16GB DDR5 RAM sticks (requires 2 sticks to be installed)
    *   1x 1TB NVMe SSD
    *   1x USB-C Backpack (Accessory)

### **Scenario A: The "Happy Path" (Successful Fulfillment)**

This demonstrates the ideal workflow from start to finish, highlighting the built-in quality control.

1.  **Order Acceptance & Work Order Creation:**
    *   The `acceptance` module fetches `ORDER-XYZ-123` from the Best Buy API.
    *   The `shipping` module immediately creates a Canada Post shipping label to meet your marketplace KPI for fast shipping. The tracking number and a unique **refund URL** are saved.
    *   Crucially, the system now creates a new entry in our PostgreSQL `work_orders` table with the status `pending_preparation`. It also creates corresponding entries in the `work_order_items` table for each physical item that needs to be packed (the laptop chassis, two RAM sticks, the SSD, and the backpack).

2.  **Preparation & Hardware Validation (Operator's Task):**
    *   An operator sees `ORDER-XYZ-123` appear on the **Fulfillment Dashboard GUI**.
    *   They print the "Work Order Sheet," which details all the components needed.
    *   They assemble the laptop, installing the 2x16GB RAM sticks and the 1TB SSD.
    *   They run the `hardware_validator.ps1` script on the newly assembled laptop. The script outputs a JSON object detailing the exact hardware specs (e.g., CPU, storage model, and a list of two individual 16GB RAM sticks).

3.  **Verification & Error Prevention (The System's Role):**
    *   **Human Error Check #1 (Hardware Mismatch):** In the GUI, the operator is prompted to scan the barcode generated from the PowerShell script's output. The backend compares this against a target barcode generated from the order's Bill of Materials in the database.
        *   *If the operator had mistakenly installed 1x32GB RAM stick, the barcodes would not match, the GUI would show a "FAIL: Incorrect RAM configuration" error, and the process would halt, preventing an incorrect item from being shipped.*
    *   **Human Error Check #2 (Item Mismatch):** Since the hardware matches, the GUI shows "PASS". The operator now scans the barcode for the USB-C Backpack accessory. The system verifies it's the correct accessory for this order.

4.  **Finalization & Shipping:**
    *   With all items verified, the backend updates the work order status to `ready_for_shipping`.
    *   The operator packages the laptop and the backpack.
    *   **Human Error Check #3 (Wrong Box/Label):** The operator scans the shipping barcode on the physical box and then the shipping barcode on the printed label. The system confirms they match. The GUI shows "FINAL PASS" and the operator affixes the label.
    *   The `tracking` module, on its next cycle, sees the order is `ready_for_shipping` and updates the Best Buy marketplace with the tracking number. The work order status is updated to `shipped`.

### **Scenario B: The "Exception Path" (Mid-Process Cancellation)**

This demonstrates the system's resilience and automation.

1.  **Event:** The customer cancels the order on the Best Buy website while our operator is still gathering the components for `ORDER-XYZ-123`. The work order status in our database is still `pending_preparation`.

2.  **System's Automated Response:**
    *   Within 15 minutes, the new `cancellation_manager` module runs.
    *   It queries the Best Buy API for the status of all its active work orders, including `ORDER-XYZ-123`.
    *   It detects that the marketplace status for `ORDER-XYZ-123` is now `CANCELLED`.
    *   The system immediately updates the work order's status in our local database to `cancelled_by_marketplace`.
    *   **Cost-Saving Automation:** The system sees that a shipping label was already created for this order. It retrieves the unique `refund_url` from the database and automatically makes a `POST` request to the Canada Post API to void the shipment and request a refund. The `shipping_label_voided` flag is set to `TRUE`.

3.  **Error Prevention:**
    *   The `ORDER-XYZ-123` work order instantly disappears from the "Pending" view in the Fulfillment Dashboard. This prevents the operator from wasting any time or resources preparing a cancelled order.

### **Summary of Findings**

This simulation demonstrates that the V2 architecture we have designed is not just a refactoring but a significant upgrade in capability:

*   **Robustness:** By using a central PostgreSQL database as the single source of truth for fulfillment status, we eliminate the risks of a fragile, file-based system.
*   **Error Prevention:** The multi-stage barcode verification process provides strong, testable guarantees against the most common and costly human fulfillment errors.
*   **Efficiency & Automation:** The automated cancellation checker and label-voiding mechanism saves both labor and money by handling cancellations gracefully without any human intervention.
*   **Scalability:** This event-driven, database-backed architecture is highly scalable and provides the solid foundation needed for the future V3/V4 AI-driven features we discussed.
