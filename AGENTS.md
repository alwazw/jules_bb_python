# Workflow Guidelines
This section describes the process for collaborating effectively.

**Task Assignment:** Use GitHub issues to assign work. Assign a task to "Jules" for autonomous work. For smaller tasks, a human team member will use the Gemini CLI locally.

**Code Review:** All changes, regardless of the contributor (Jules, human, etc.), must be reviewed and merged by a human team member.

**Communication:** All communication and progress tracking will happen within GitHub issues and pull requests.
